# Israel Municipalities GeoJSON (2025)

This repository contains a GeoJSON file outlining the boundaries of **981 municipalities** in Israel, as of 2025.

**Important Note:** There are an additional **267 smaller places** (relevant for 2025) that have not yet been included in this GeoJSON file. I intend to add these in a future update.

## Data Sources

The data in this GeoJSON file is compiled from the following sources:

* **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** A collaboratively built, free geographic database of the world. Data sourced from OSM is licensed under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/). You must attribute OSM and its contributors when using this data.
* **"גבולות שיפוט - שכבות הרצף" (Shpufim Boundaries - Continuous Layers) from the Israeli Ministry of the Interior:** This official dataset provides administrative boundaries for Israel. Please refer to the specific license terms associated with this data from the Ministry of the Interior for usage and attribution requirements.

## License

The data in this repository is licensed under the **Open Database License (ODbL)**, as the combined dataset includes data derived from OpenStreetMap. By using this data, you agree to the terms and conditions of the ODbL.

[https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/)

You are free to copy, distribute, and use the Database; to produce works from the Database; to modify, transform, and build upon the Database; provided that you:

1.  **Attribute:** You must attribute the data in the manner specified in the ODbL, including providing a link to the license and indicating if changes were made. For OSM data, this typically involves crediting "© OpenStreetMap contributors". For the Israeli Ministry of the Interior data, you should provide attribution as specified in their licensing terms.
2.  **Share-Alike:** If you publicly use any adapted version of this Database, or a Database produced from an adapted Database, you must offer that adapted Database under the same terms of this License.
3.  **Keep Open:** If you redistribute the Database, or an adapted version of it, you must ensure that the Database remains Open and does not restrict other persons from using the Database.

## Usage

This file (`your_geojson_filename.geojson`) can be used in various GIS software, web mapping libraries, and other applications that support the GeoJSON format.

## Future Work

As mentioned, the boundaries for approximately 267 smaller places in Israel are currently missing from this dataset. I plan to incorporate this data in a future update to provide a more comprehensive representation of Israeli municipalities.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to the contributors of OpenStreetMap and the Israeli Ministry of the Interior for making their data available.
